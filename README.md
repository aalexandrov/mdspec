# Spectest - lightweight BDD testing for Rust

A lightweight library for defining behavior-driven development (BDD) style tests in exernal files and running them with `cargo test`.
This can be seen as a successor / alternative of the [datadriven][datadriven] crate.

Please consult [the `spectest` docs][rustdocs] and [the integration tests](/src/spectest/tests) for details.
